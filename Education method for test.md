  Gretting for everyone, who reading this file. Who knows, perhaps someday it will be interesting for someone?
So...I started studying how to code and programming a week ago and after this time I decided to make a schedule of " My programm" =)
The main thing i decided to is - While studying simple programming and reading books try to remember solutions of the most difficult task given by LeetCode.
At first sight it may seems strange, but I have my own theory of studying progrtamming and i want to test it by myself. 
Hope three-four months will be enough for such test, but first results I will see in a month i guess...See you soon!
