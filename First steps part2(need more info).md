So a week ago I started learning how to programm in Python. Many people thinking that buying courses is the best way, though many of them droppep.
Thus i understood that it does not matter how you studying. The only and the one thig is important - You must continue!
In such way you may find a lot of free courses by different authors and they're really nice!
Assuming all I need some time to study as much possibilities as I can before I make the hole programm.
Let's say couple or three weeks will be enough.
