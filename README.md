                                                    -= The Beginning =-
This is the beginning of a new story about one of those men, who started to learn programming by himsels and it's very interesting how far i'll be able to go to!
Perhaps, someday half a year later someone will find this text and smile. Who knows, maybe i'll be working as a junior or a middle by that time!
Anyway while typing I'm feeling real interest in this theme and I'm going to test my abilities despite the age!
Especially in my backgroun there is a lot of expirience working and managing big groups and in planning and implementation big projects but in different area.
Thus, it's much more interesting for me trying to use all my experience in programming.
All I need is just to find out how it works. That's all. I know how to work by hands...I know the English language...No doubt that we hold ourselves with our hands
And the only thing left to open the way is to go forward!
